# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a graphical user interface (GUI) to the existing CLI-based translation pipeline, making it accessible to non-technical users while maintaining all current functionality. The GUI will provide an intuitive interface for translation workflows, style guide extraction, glossary management, and translation memory operations without requiring command-line knowledge.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a non-technical user, I want a desktop application with a clean interface, so that I can perform translations without using command-line tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a main window with tabbed interface for different operations
2. WHEN the user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback for all operations
3. WHEN the user performs any operation THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators and status messages
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with suggested solutions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a translator, I want to translate documents through a GUI, so that I can easily configure translation settings and monitor progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects the translation tab THEN the system SHALL display file selection, language selection, and optional resource configuration
2. WHEN the user selects an input file THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and display file information
3. WHEN the user configures translation settings THEN the system SHALL provide dropdowns for languages and file browsers for optional resources
4. WHEN translation starts THEN the system SHALL display a progress bar and real-time status updates
5. WHEN human review is required THEN the system SHALL pause execution and display an interactive review dialog
6. WHEN translation completes THEN the system SHALL display the results in a side-by-side view with save options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to extract style guides from documents, so that I can standardize translation practices across my team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects the style extraction tab THEN the system SHALL display file selection and format options
2. WHEN the user selects a source file THEN the system SHALL automatically detect file type when possible
3. WHEN the user configures extraction settings THEN the system SHALL validate language codes and file paths
4. WHEN extraction starts THEN the system SHALL display progress and processing status
5. WHEN extraction completes THEN the system SHALL display the generated style guide with preview and save options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a terminology manager, I want to extract and manage glossaries through the GUI, so that I can maintain consistent terminology without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects the glossary tab THEN the system SHALL display options for TMX-based or text-based extraction
2. WHEN the user selects extraction source THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate configuration options for the selected type
3. WHEN glossary extraction runs THEN the system SHALL display progress and term discovery status
4. WHEN extraction completes THEN the system SHALL display the glossary in an editable table format
5. WHEN the user edits glossary entries THEN the system SHALL validate term pairs and allow inline editing
6. WHEN the user saves the glossary THEN the system SHALL export to CSV format with proper encoding

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance specialist, I want to review translation results interactively, so that I can ensure translation quality before finalizing outputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automatic review is enabled THEN the system SHALL display detailed scoring breakdowns by dimension
2. WHEN review scores are below threshold THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic areas with explanations
3. WHEN the user requests manual review THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side comparison with editing capabilities
4. WHEN the user modifies translations during review THEN the system SHALL update quality scores in real-time
5. WHEN review is complete THEN the system SHALL allow the user to accept, reject, or request re-translation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a workflow administrator, I want to manage translation resources centrally, so that I can maintain consistent configurations across translation projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses resource management THEN the system SHALL display current glossaries, style guides, and TMX files
2. WHEN the user imports new resources THEN the system SHALL validate file formats and display import status
3. WHEN the user manages existing resources THEN the system SHALL provide preview, edit, and delete capabilities
4. WHEN resource conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL prompt for resolution with clear options
5. WHEN resources are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh dependent configurations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the application to remember my preferences and recent files, so that I can work efficiently across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL restore the last used tab and window configuration
2. WHEN the user selects files THEN the system SHALL remember recent file locations and display them in quick access
3. WHEN the user configures settings THEN the system SHALL persist language preferences and default resource locations
4. WHEN the user closes the application THEN the system SHALL save current state and preferences automatically
5. WHEN the user reopens the application THEN the system SHALL restore previous session state including unsaved work

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a batch processing user, I want to queue multiple translation jobs, so that I can process multiple documents efficiently without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user adds multiple files THEN the system SHALL display a job queue with configurable settings per job
2. WHEN batch processing starts THEN the system SHALL process jobs sequentially with overall progress tracking
3. WHEN individual jobs complete THEN the system SHALL update job status and continue with remaining items
4. WHEN errors occur in batch mode THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue processing remaining jobs
5. WHEN batch processing completes THEN the system SHALL display a summary report with success/failure statistics
