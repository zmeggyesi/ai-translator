# Style Guide for Technical Text Localization

This style guide provides comprehensive guidelines for translating technical texts from English to Spanish, focusing on tone, register, punctuation, preferred constructions, formatting conventions, voice, and notable stylistic patterns. This guide is intended to ensure consistency and clarity in future translations of similar technical documents.

## Tone and Register

### Tone
- **Professional and Formal**: The tone should be professional and formal, suitable for technical and informational content. Avoid colloquial expressions and maintain a respectful and authoritative tone.

### Register
- **Formal Register**: Use a formal register appropriate for technical documentation. This includes using formal pronouns and verb forms (e.g., "usted" instead of "tú").

## Punctuation

### General Punctuation
- **Commas and Periods**: Use commas to separate items in a list and periods to end complete sentences. Ensure punctuation is consistent with Spanish norms.
- **Colons**: Use colons to introduce lists or explanations, as seen in the example: "Para obtener más información o programar una cita, llame al:"

### Lists
- **Numbered Lists**: Use Arabic numerals followed by a parenthesis for numbered lists (e.g., "1)"). Ensure that each item in the list is clearly separated by punctuation, such as commas or periods, depending on the structure of the list.

## Preferred Constructions

### Sentence Structure
- **Direct and Clear**: Maintain direct and clear sentence structures. Avoid overly complex sentences that may confuse the reader.
- **Active Voice**: Prefer active voice constructions to passive voice for clarity and directness.

### Specific Constructions
- **Conditional Statements**: Use clear conditional constructions, ensuring that the condition and result are easily identifiable.
- **Imperative Mood**: Use the imperative mood for instructions and calls to action, as seen in "llame al" (call).

## Formatting Conventions

### Text Formatting
- **Bold and Italics**: Use bold for headings and important terms. Italics can be used for emphasis or to denote foreign terms not commonly used in Spanish.
- **Quotation Marks**: Use Spanish-style quotation marks (« ») for direct quotes or to highlight specific terms.

### Numerical and List Formatting
- **Numbers**: Use Arabic numerals for lists and technical specifications. Ensure consistency in number formatting, especially in technical contexts.
- **Lists**: Use clear and consistent formatting for lists, ensuring each item is easily distinguishable.

## Voice

### Consistency
- **Consistent Voice**: Maintain a consistent voice throughout the document. This includes using the same level of formality and tone across all sections.

### Pronouns
- **Formal Pronouns**: Use formal pronouns ("usted") to address the reader, maintaining a respectful and professional tone.

## Notable Stylistic Patterns

### Translation of Terms
- **Technical Terms**: Ensure accurate translation of technical terms, using established equivalents in Spanish where available. If a term does not have a direct equivalent, provide a clear explanation or description.
- **Consistency in Terminology**: Use consistent terminology throughout the document to avoid confusion.

### Clarity and Precision
- **Clear Explanations**: Provide clear and precise explanations, especially for complex technical concepts. Avoid ambiguity and ensure that the reader can easily understand the content.

### Examples and Illustrations
- **Use of Examples**: Incorporate examples to illustrate complex points, ensuring they are relevant and clearly explained.

By adhering to these guidelines, translators can ensure that technical texts are translated accurately and effectively, maintaining the intended meaning and tone of the original content while making it accessible to Spanish-speaking audiences.
