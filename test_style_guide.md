### Style Guide for Bilingual Translations

This style guide is designed to assist translators in producing consistent and high-quality translations for similar content. It covers various aspects such as tone, register, punctuation, preferred constructions, formatting conventions, voice, and notable stylistic patterns.

#### Tone and Register
- **Tone**: The tone should be professional and informative. It should convey clarity and precision, suitable for formal and semi-formal contexts.
- **Register**: Use a formal register, especially in contexts related to healthcare, employment, and technical information. Avoid colloquial expressions and maintain a respectful and authoritative tone.

#### Punctuation
- **Commas and Periods**: Follow standard punctuation rules in both languages. Ensure that commas and periods are placed correctly, especially in lists and complex sentences.
- **Quotation Marks**: Use quotation marks for direct speech or specific terms that need emphasis. In Spanish, use « » for quotations when applicable, but " " is also acceptable.
- **Lists**: Use numbers or bullet points for lists. Ensure consistency in list formatting, using periods after each list item in Spanish.

#### Preferred Constructions
- **Direct Translations**: Aim for direct translations where possible, but prioritize naturalness and readability in the target language.
- **Passive Voice**: Use active voice where possible to maintain clarity and engagement. For example, "Your selection(s) must be offered by your employer" is translated actively as "Su empleador debe ofrecer los planes que usted elija."
- **Subject-Verb Agreement**: Ensure that subjects and verbs agree in number and person in both languages.

#### Formatting Conventions
- **Text Formatting**: Maintain the original formatting of the source text, including bold, italics, and underlining, unless specified otherwise.
- **XML and Code Elements**: Preserve XML tags and code elements as they appear in the source. Ensure that any additional attributes, such as `xml:space="default"`, are included in the translation.
- **Capitalization**: Follow the capitalization rules of the target language. For example, in Spanish, only the first word and proper nouns are capitalized in titles.

#### Voice
- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent voice throughout the document. Use the same level of formality and style in all sections.
- **Second Person**: Use the formal "usted" form in Spanish to address the reader, ensuring respect and formality.

#### Notable Stylistic Patterns
- **Healthcare and Technical Terms**: Translate technical terms accurately, ensuring that they are understandable to the target audience. Use established translations for medical and technical terminology.
- **Clarity and Simplicity**: Prioritize clarity and simplicity in translations. Avoid overly complex sentence structures that may confuse the reader.
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Be aware of cultural differences and ensure that translations are culturally appropriate for the target audience.

#### Examples
- **Titles and Headings**: Translate titles and headings directly, maintaining the original intent and meaning. For example, "Summer Extension" becomes "Extensión de verano."
- **Instructions and Information**: Provide clear and concise translations for instructions and informational content. For example, "For more information or to schedule an appointment, please call:" is translated as "Para obtener más información o programar una cita, llame al."

By adhering to this style guide, translators can ensure that their work is consistent, accurate, and culturally appropriate, providing a seamless experience for the target audience.
